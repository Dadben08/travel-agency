        <h1>HOW TO RESET YOUR MIND WITH A SELF-CARE RESET TRIP</h1>
        <p>If you've never actually gone on a self-care reset trip, then you've been missing out! Not only do you get to explore the beauty of this world, but you get the <br>opportunity to reset your frame of mind if it's grown stale, stuffy, and tired from the burdens of life. Today, GlobalNomad lists a few destinations you just have to visit</p>

        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">NEW MEXICO</p>
        <span><img src="/image/new mexico.jpg" alt="" class="imgblog"></span>
        <br>
        <br>


        <p>New Mexico is a great place to visit if you are looking for a mountainous escape with beautiful lakes. From an affordability point of view, New Mexico is a wonderfully <br>affordable place to live, with a low tax threshold for family households. What's more, New Mexico was recently ranked as the second kindest state in the country, <br>which could be just the remedy for you if you're looking for good company and conversation.</p>
        <br><br>



        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">ATLANTA</p>
        <span><img src="/image/imgAtlanta.jpg" alt="" class="imgblog"></span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Atlanta is one of those places you'll feel blessed to have seen. In fact, it is remarkable what this larger-than-life city has to offer. Atlanta BeltLine notes that <br>phenomenal outdoor activities include the development of the BeltLine, which includes 2,000 magnificent public parks to take advantage of. As a vacation rental option, <br>you're sure to find properties that are within your price range. If not, then there are other avenues to purchasing a holiday home. For example, you <br>could elect to take out another mortgage on your existing home, or you could leverage a home equity loan to make owning a vacation home possible.</p>
        <br><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">FORT LAUDERDALE</p>
        <span><img src="/image/imgFORT LAUDERDALE.jpg" alt="" class="imgblog"></span>
        <br><br>
        <p>Florida is like a beachside resort that you'll never grow tired of. With a laid-back lifestyle, you can escape the pressures of daily life and really kick back here to behold the natural beauty of sun-kissed <br>dunes and ocean blues around you. Florida for Boomers points out that Florida also ranks low in the Cost of Living Index, making it an excellent place to settle permanently.</p><br><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">SEATTLE</p>
        <span><img src="/image/imgseatle.jpg" alt="" class="imgblog"></span>
        <br><br>
        <p>Seattle is another marvelous destination if you want to explore the unexpected. It has incredible nature and architectural <br>beauty and has one of the best restaurant scenes in the country. You're also likely to get by comfortably from an affordability point of view.  <br> If you love it so much, you could even buy a vacation rental here to make it official. If you can't afford the usual down payment of around 20% to <br>secure a property, then consider taking out a second mortgage on your primary home to help finance this. The other option is a home equity <br> loan that you could use to negotiate finance based on the amount outstanding on your existing mortgage</p>
